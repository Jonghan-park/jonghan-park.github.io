# Outline  

The purpose of this posting is to look at what React is and what features React has. Beside, I'm going to upload the video for installation of React environment and demonstration of how to use React features.

# What is React❔

<img src="/assets/REACT_logo.png" alt="reactLogo" width="300"/>

**React** is a free and open-source front-end _JavaScript library_ that focuses on creating a UI (User Interface) for single-page applications. React is for **Web** and **Mobile** and not *Framework* like Angular and Blazor, and React is not MVC design pattern. React uses a simple grammar called **JavaScript XML (JSX)** that contains HTML in JavaScript and one-way data binding, and it is a library that uses the concept of Virtual DOM to optimize the performance of web applications. React lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

As I said, **React** is a JavaScript library that creates UI in single-page applications, so it is insufficient compared to other frameworks that create single-page applications. React, for example, does not provide page switching, so if you need to switch pages using React, you need to use additional libraries such as **react-router.**

# What features do React have❔
- Independent **components** based
- Constant maintenance by Facebook
- **JSX**(JS + HTML)  
  HTML is used in JS.

1️⃣ Independent **components** based  

So, what is component ❓😕  
> Component is the "Unit module that performs independent functions in 
> Computer hardware system."  

Unlike hardware, software is not developed independently and is often not developed considering compatibility with other modules, so it was difficult to reuse and manage it. Components are technologies that have emerged to increase software reuse and enable maintenance. When developing web services with react, the UI is constructed using a small, isolated code called a component in React.  

```js
  const greeting = () => {
    return <h1>Hello, </h1>;
  };

  const name = () => {
    return <h1>Jonghan !</h1>;
  };
```

I made two components. One named **greeting** returns "Hello, " string message, and another component named **name** returns "Jonghan !" string message. Now, I can use the componentes whenever or wherever I want.  
  
```js
  const App = () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <greeting />
        <name />
      </div>
    );
  };
```

These isolated and small components can be reused, and the reuse can improve development productivity. These components are also easy to test which helps maintain the code.  
  
There are two types of components defined in React: a **class-based component** and a **function-based component**.  

1️⃣ - 1️⃣ Class-based component  
  
**Class-based component** defines it as class and returns the jsx code from the render() function.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    const name = 'React';
    return (
      <div className="react">
        <h1>{name}</h1>;
        <p>A JavaScript library</p>;
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```  
Class-based component 
- inherits a class named Component provided by React.  
- has a state function that defines the state of the component.  
- has lifecycle method functions that execute functions depending on the state of the component. (three states of the component: Mount when the component appears on the screen (Mount), updates (Update), and disappears (Umount).  
- must be a render function and write the code you want to return using JSX.
