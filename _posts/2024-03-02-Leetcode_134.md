A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2\*3)+((8)/4))+1"
Output: 3
Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.
Example 2:

Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
Output: 3

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of digits 0-9 and characters '+', '-', '\*', '/', '(', and ')'.
It is guaranteed that parentheses expression s is a VPS.

```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxDepth = function (s) {
  let count = 0;
  let max = 0;

  for (let char of s) {
    if (char === "(") count++;
    if (char === ")") count--;
    if (count > max) {
      max = Math.max(count, max);
    }
  }
  return max;
};
```

The time complexity of this code is O(n) because it iterates through each character in the input string 's' exactly once, where n is the length of the string.

The space complexity of this code is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input string. The variables count and max are the only extra space used, and they do not depend on the size of the input.
